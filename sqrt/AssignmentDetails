Develop a program in sqrt.cpp to compute the square root of a double using Newton's method.

The main function should take in either one or two command line arguments, both of which are doubles.

The first argument is the number of which to take the square root.  It is, of course, a required argument.
The second argument is optional.  It is the value of epsilon, the amount by which the abs(last_guess - next_guess) is allowed to differ.  If no argument is supplied, espilon should be set to 1e-7, which is 10-7.
You must implement the function that has the following header:

double sqrt(double num, double epsilon)
